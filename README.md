## Master branch
Master branch has a discontinued object segmentation framework that unifies follow works on a unique Python code:

## graph-canny branch

This branch has adapted master branch code that run graph-canny work on "mestrado" dataset, throught file run.py.

Also uses Python call from C++ library generated on https://github.com/zisluiz/graph-canny-segm rep. 

Results obtained with "mestrado" dataset will be public available soon, comparing this approach with others semantic sgmentation algorithms.
